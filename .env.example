# check_connectivity.py — Environment Variables
#
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values. The script reads from
# environment variables directly (no .env auto-loading). For cron, either
# source the file or export the variables in a wrapper script.
#
# Feature availability is determined by whether the required env vars are
# set. CLI flags (--email, --no-email, etc.) override per-invocation.

# --- Interfaces ---
# Comma-separated name:label[:expected_org] entries.
# The label is a human-readable name for alerts. The optional third field
# is the expected ISP organization name for WHOIS verification.
# If no label is given, the interface name is used as its own label.
# INTERFACES=eth0:Primary Connection:BELL CANADA,wlan0:Wi-Fi Connection:STARLINK

# --- Test Websites ---
# Comma-separated hostnames to test HTTPS connectivity against.
# WEBSITES=one.one.one.one,google.com

# --- SMTP (required for email alerts) ---
# If any of these are missing, email alerts are disabled but connectivity
# checks still run and state is still saved.

# --- SMTP (optional, with defaults) ---
# SMTP_PORT=465
# SMTP_USE_SSL=true
# SMTP_TIMEOUT=10

# --- Telegram (required for Telegram alerts) ---
# If either is missing, Telegram alerts are disabled.
# TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
# TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=

# --- WHOIS / ISP Verification ---
# When enabled, verifies each interface routes through its expected ISP
# (set via the third field in INTERFACES). Requires curl and whois.
# WHOIS_ENABLED=false
# IP_LOOKUP_URL=https://api.ipify.org

# --- State File ---
# Absolute path to the CSV file that persists interface state between runs.
# Relative paths resolve from the working directory where the script is invoked,
# NOT from the script's own directory. Use an absolute path to avoid surprises
# (e.g., cron runs from / by default).
